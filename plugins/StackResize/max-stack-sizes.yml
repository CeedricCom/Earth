#  You can define the max stack size for every kind of material.
#
#  You can either do so by specifying the exact material name ("ENDER_PEARL")
#   or by using regular expressions.
#
#  For example, "^(.*)_CHESTPLATE$" will apply to ALL kinds of chestplates.
#
#  If both, a regular expression and an exact definition match a material,
#   the stack size of the exact definition will be used. For example, if you
#   set "^.*_CHESTPLATE" to 8 and "DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE" to 16, then all
#   chestplates can stack up to 8 items, while a diamond chestplate can be
#   stacked up to 16 items.
#
#  Note: Please only use UPPER_CASE names.
#
#  Here is a list of all valid material names in the latest MC version:
#    https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
#
#  Please note that you cannot stack items in your inventory when you are
#   in creative mode, because creative inventory is handled client side.

#######################################

# Although StackResize does its best to support every kind of stacked item, there are currently some limitations.
# Most of them will be resolved in the futures though. Currently, the following limitations apply:

#  1. Max stack sizes cannot be set to higher than 64, because the vanilla client won't let you stack them anyway.
#     This might be possible in the future, though :-)
#
#  2. If you use plugins that let you open Shulker Boxes without placing them, you WILL encounter item loss if you make
#     Shulker Boxes stackable. So: Only make them stackable if you do not use any of those plugins (e.g. ShulkerPacks)!
#
#  3. Max stack sizes can only be adjusted per MATERIAL, not per individual item. That means, for example:
#     You can make all regular potions (POTION) stack up to 16, lingering potions (LINGERING_POTION) stack up to 8
#     and splash potions (SPLASH_POTION) stack up to 4, but you cannot set different amounts for different potion
#     types like healing, fire resistance, etc. This is a vanilla limitation and can not be avoided.

#####        Configuration        #####

# Some modded clients have problems with adjusted max stack sizes. We can avoid this by sending inventory update packets
# to the player after they did certain interactions. You should leave this enabled.
update-inventories: true

# When you make items stackable that can be inserted by hoppers into special blocks (e.g. potions into brewing stands,
# lava buckets into furnaces, etc), AND if you also set hoppers to move more than one item at once (spigot.yml),
# it can lead to unwanted side effects, e.g. potions stacking in the brewing table. To avoid this, StackResize
# can fix that. When you didn't change the hopper-amount, StackResize will not listen to the hopper event.
fix-hoppers: true

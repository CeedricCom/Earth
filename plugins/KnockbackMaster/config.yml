#                    KNOCKBACK                     #
#**************************************************#
# Section related to the Knockback values and multipliers.
# Be aware of the difference between a value and a multiplier (more below)
#
# These default config values emulate the standard knockback
# in Minecraft. Proceed by applying small modifications.
#
# FOR CUSTOM KNOCKBACK (PER WORLD), PLEASE CHECK AT
# THE VERY BOTTOM OF THIS CONFIG FILE.
#**************************************************#
knockback:
  # Should the knockback module (normal,sprinting,in-air,enchantment) be enabled?
  # Setting this to "false" will let the Spigot server handle the hits and the related knockback.
  enabled: true

  # DEFAULT KNOCKBACK VALUES
  # THE FOLLOWING APPLIES FOR ALL WORLDS (IF NOT DIFFERENTLY SPECIFIED BELOW)
  # Example: If you want in worldB a different "normal.vertical" modifier, just create
  # a "worldB" entry in the section at the end of the config and specify JUST the "normal.vertical" value
  # All the other values will be taken from the following default ones.
  #
  normal:
    # Horizontal knockback, affects only X and Z coordinate values.
    horizontal: 0.4
    # Vertical knockback, affects only Y coordinate value.
    vertical: 0.36

  # Sprinting knockback values. This multipliers will be used if the damager is sprinting
  # By default in Minecraft, if the damager player is sprinting, he deals more knockback to the damaged one.
  # This is the reason of PvP movement-related actions like W-tapping.
  sprinting:
    # Select the sprinting module system. Available values: "standard" and "legacy".
    # "standard" is the new module that will improve the sprinting detection (better detection)
    # "legacy" is the old method (pre v2.10.0) that you may find better if you started with a version below 2.10.0.
    # If you set "legacy" as method, you should set the "knockback.air.horizontal" multiplier to 1.0 to achieve the exact same
    # as version 2.9 and below.
    mode: "standard"
    # Horizontal sprint knockback, affects only X and Z coordinate values.
    horizontal: 0.8
    # Vertical sprint knockback, affects only Y coordinate value.
    vertical: 0.42

  # Air knockback multipliers. Section related to the knockback that a player should receive if in air.
  # Usually, if the damaged player is taking damage while he's in the air, he will receive less knockback
  # both horizontally and vertically.
  air:

    horizontal: 0.6

  # Enchantment section.
  enchantment:
    # Knockback enchantment multipliers. You can configure a specific multiplier (or value) for each knockback level (Knockback I, II, etc.)
    # If you have, for instance, KnockbackIV, you can add '4' after '3'. If you set 1.10, this results in a 10% increase.
    # If you set 2.15, this results in a 115% increase. The default values are similar to the standard Knockback I and II.
    #
    # If you do NOT want multipliers but instead you want custom values for a specific knockback enchantment level,
    # you can add "horizontal" and "vertical" to the specific knockback level like following example.
    #
    # You can have all of the following values as multipliers, values or both, like in the example below that works like this:
    # Knockback I will have a 105% increase in knockback.normal or knockback.sprinting values
    # Knockback II will have a 190% increase
    # Knockback III will overwrite knockback.normal values and sets them to 1.1 and 0.45 relatively.
    # Please note that in the example below, the lines after '3' must have correct spacing or the config file will be invalid.

        vertical: 0.45
      # If the enchantment level is none of the above, this multiplier will be used. This can only be a multiplier.

    # enchantment.

# Custom knockback for specific worlds. Please specify world names lower-case!
# How does it work?
# 1) KnockbackMaster will read the values above in "knockback" section and consider them as DEFAULT.
# 2) If a custom world name is specified here, the related values will overwrite the DEFAULT ones.
# 3) You have to specify ONLY the values you want to be different from the DEFAULT ones
#
# EXAMPLE:
# If you want to modify just the knockback.normal.horizontal and vertical values for world "MyCustomKbWorld1"
# you have to write just 2 values under "mycustomworld1" section (note that world names must be lower-case)
# you can follow the default example below:
custom-worlds:
  # Set to TRUE to enable custom KB by specifying worlds below.
  enabled: false
  worlds:
    # Example world 1 (you can remove or edit this)

#           be altered upon plugin specifictions in iConomy 5.0
#   - Interest amount is done in seconds.
#     - Online
#       If only true, only one bank / account will recieve money for that player.
#       If only false, it will go through each bank / account and deposit money.

#         Each time interest runs you can either deposit the money into a bank (Interest)
#         or directly into a players holdings (Wage).
#     - Interval
#       - Seconds
#         Basic Table:
#           1 minute = 60 seconds
#           1 hour = 1 minute * 60 = 3600 seconds
#           1 day = 1 hour * 24 = 86400 seconds
#           1 week = 1 day * 7 = 604800 seconds
#   - Database
#     - Type
#       Can only be h2 or MySQL, no longer supports SQLite.
#     - Settings
#       If you choose h2, only the first two are needed, do not alter MySQL.
#       - MySQL
#         Do not use remote databases from free sites, please use either a
#          remote database from a personal hosted VPS or DEDI or a local
#          database. This will prevent any 'timeout' or 'invalid settings'
#          or 'cannot connect to database' issues. Thank you :)!

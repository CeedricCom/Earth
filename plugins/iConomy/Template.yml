# Colors
#   Previously you would use a utf-8 character to use colors, this has been replaced
#   to make your lives easier, there are 3 different methods of adding color to your lines
#   each orchestrated for a different personality type.
#
#   Whichever is easiest for you to remember; They all do the same, and you can mix and match.
#
#   Methods: &[code] or `[name-code] or the easier alternative InEquality Signed color brackets: <color>
#
#   Color Mapping:
#     &c `c Color     &c `c Color
#     -- -- -----     -- -- -----
#     &0 `k black     &f `w white
#     &1 `B navy      &a `g lime
#     &2 `G green     &b `a aqua
#     &3 `A teal      &c `r rose
#     &4 `R red       &d `p pink
#     &5 `P purple    &e `y yellow
#     &6 `Y gold
#     &7 `s silver
#     &8 `S gray
#     &9 `b blue
#
#     For black would be: <black> or `k or &0
#     Example using Inequality: <green>Hi I'm green! <white>Now White!?
#     Example using &: &2Hi I'm green! &fNow White!?
#     Example using `: `GHi I'm green! `wNow White!?
#     Example using all: `GI'm Green, &fWhite, <yellow>and Yellow!

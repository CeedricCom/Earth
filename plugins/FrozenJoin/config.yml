# » Join/Quit Formats
# Here you can create new objects whom you can apply with permissions
# to your players. You may create infinite objects with fully custom
# join & quit messages. (No format should have the same priority!).
#
#
# » Priorities
# are used to define which format gets used if the user has access
# to multiple, they are listed from lowest to highest, 1 being lowest and above being highest.
# Meaning highest priority format (in the example below 2), will be applied to the player
# if they have access to both.
#
#
# » Format Types
# are used to allow for further customisations when it comes to display
# join and quite message, for instance using the "RANDOM" format type you are able to
# execute a random action specified inside the format, thus randomizing join/quit messages
# "DEFAULT" format type being the format type as you have known from before, "VANISH" format
# type being a format which will detect if a user is vanished, with the ability to invert
# the messages.
#
# Available Format Types: "RANDOM", "NORMAL", "VANISH"
#
formats:
  default:
    priority: 3
    type: 'NORMAL'

############## Invisibility Method ###############
##################################################
InvisibilityMethod:
  # The method of hiding players; Available methods: Prevention, Interception, Hybrid

  # 'Prevention': Uses Bukkit's API to hide players, this is an extremely reliable method if other plugins don't break it.
  # This method ALWAYS hides invisible players in the tablist for players that can't see them.
  # The chance that another plugin breaks this method is low depending on the amount and type of plugins.
  # > Recommended if other hiders cause issues; other plugins can break this method though
  # (Accuracy: 95%) (Plugin compatibility: 95%) (Uses game layer invisibility)

  # 'Interception': Uses ProtocolLib to hide players. Takes the whole packet stuff into its own hands to cancel every
  # single packet of hidden players. This option is currently not supported on 1.19.3 or higher.
  # This method CAN show invisible players in the tablist for players who can't see them if that's enabled.
  # Hard to break, however, other plugins might not provide direct support for this hider
  # It's important to note that Essentials might not recognize vanished players as vanished in its commands with this hider.
  # > Recommended if you want to show invisible players in the tablist
  # (Accuracy: 95%) (Plugin compatibility: 90%) (Uses protocol layer invisibility)

  # 'Hybrid: Uses both ProtocolLib and Bukkit's API to hide players, this method does NOT support showing players
  # in the tablist but it contains two layers of security and is therefore an extremely effective method.
  # The chance that another plugin breaks this method is extremely small
  # > Default hider; Recommended if you don't want to show invisible players in the tablist
  # (Accuracy: 100%) (Plugin compatibility: 98%) (Uses game and protocol layer invisibility) - DEFAULT

  PlayerHider: "Hybrid"

  # Note: Even 'Hybrid' can't stop players from figuring out whether invisible players are online if another
  # plugin tells them but players will never be able to see them at all or figure out their location
  # (Essentials is 99% compatible)

  Advanced:
  # Advanced section which affects the protocol layer invisibility for the Interception and Hybrid hiders

    # Which protocol layer invisibility modules should be disabled?
    # You can disable some modules here if they are causing issues or aren't supported on
    # your server after an update or if you are using the Interception hider and simply don't want players
    # to be invisible in some regards.
    # You are unlikely to note invisibility changes here if you are using the Hybrid hider since it also has
    # game layer invisibility which isn't affected here
    # It's recommended to instead use the HideInTablist/Game options if that's what you want to change
    DisabledInvisibilityModules:
    # Physical appearance in the game
#    - GeneralEntity
    # Sounds in the world
#    - NamedSoundEffect
    # Tablist entry (includes hide spectator mode feature)
    # Please uncomment this if you are using Maximvdw's Tab or AnimatedNames plugin and have issues with nametags
#    - PlayerInfo
    # Info about player prefixes, suffixes, etc (formerly 'StrictInvisibility'); this is
    # disabled by default since it is very likely to cause issues with nametag/prefix plugins
    # Comment this out (enable it) if it doesn't cause issues, since it can prevent vanished player information leaks
    - ScoreboardTeam
    # Tab completion suggestions (formerly 'DisableHandlingOfTabulatorPackets')
    # Enable this module if you don't use bungeecord. It's disabled by default to prevent issues with bungee

# Information:
# <..> means that .. is required; [..] means that .. is optional and can be left out; | INSIDE [] or <> stands for 'OR'
# You can use the & character for color codes. Example: '&cThe color of this text would be red!'
# You can use #XXXXXX for HEX color codes. Example: '#663EF6This text would be purple!'
# You can use %p% to get the player's name. Example: '&4&l%p%, you aren't allowed to execute this command!'
# You can use %other% to get the name of the target or cause
# You can use %d% to get the player's display name. If you use Essentials then the display name contains the prefix too
# You can use %tab% to get the player's name in the player list (TAB)
# You can use %prefix% to get the player's prefix (Requires Vault)
# You can use %suffix% to get the player's suffix (Requires Vault)
# You can use %group% to get the player's group (Requires Vault)
# You can use %nick% to get the player's nickname (Requires Essentials)
# You can use %special{<text>|<hoverMessage>|[clickCommand]|[run|suggest]}% to create a clickable/hoverable
#  message part for any message (only one per message possible)
# You can use %time{<format>}% to get the current time (Uses the server's timezone)
#  Replace <format> with the date format of your choice. Example: %time{hh:mma | yyyy/MM/dd}%
#  More info: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
# You can use %uselevel% and %seelevel% to get the player's respective vanish level (with LayeredPermissions)
# There is also %health%, %maxhealth%, %tps%, %plain_tps%, %ping% and %plain_ping%
# Some messages allow different, unique variables too
#
# NOTE: You can get WAY more placeholders by installing PlaceholderAPI or MVdWPlaceholderAPI
#
# You can also make any message dependent on a player's group by adding 'PerGroup' in front of the message:
# PerGroupNoPermission:
#   Admin: 'What, this should not happen you are the Admin!'
#   Player: 'You have like no permissions anyway'
#   Silence: ''
#   Default: 'Access denied.'
#
# You can start a message with [JSON] to send JSON text directly.
# Example: '[JSON]{"text":"Welcome %p%","color":"yellow"}'
#
# Empty messages will not be sent.
# Using \n starts a new line.
#
# Important:
# You must double single quotes if you want to use them inside a message.
# You must NOT use any tab characters inside this file (indent key) otherwise YAML will spam your console with errors!
# !! If there are errors in the console after editing this file paste it into an online YAML parser to see if
# there are any YAML syntax errors !!
